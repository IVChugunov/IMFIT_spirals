This project is a modification of IMFIT ([http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/)) with added models of spiral arms. The only difference from basic IMFIT 1.9.0 is that some models of spiral arms are implemented, and all other features remain the same.
In particular, this package has exactly the same dependencies as basic IMFIT, and the installation process is also has no differences (the instructions from the basic IMFIT can be found at docs/imfit_howto.pdf). This package do not require basic IMFIT to be installed.
The documentation for added spiral arm models is provided at "docs_spirals/model_description.pdf".
