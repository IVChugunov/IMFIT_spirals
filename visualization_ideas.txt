POSSIBLE VISUALIZATION IDEAS FOR IMAGE FITTING:

[] Plot absolute maximum (or mean, or median) of residuals as a function of radius

[] Plot log contours of different components in different colors
	e.g., plot outer exponential (disk) in blue; then plot bar component in green;
	then plot Sersic (bulge) component in red; etc.
