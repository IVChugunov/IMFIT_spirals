Design and Architecture of Imfit
================================

General design and operation of imfit
-------------------------------------

The basic operation of imfit, as implemented in imfit\_main.cpp, is:

1. Process command-line options

2. Read and process configuration file

   1. Optional data-image characteristics (A/D gain, read noise,
      original-sky background)

   2. Specifications of the model: functions, initial parameter values
      and limits

3. Read in user-supplied data from images

   1. Image to be fit

   2. Mask image, if any

   3. Noise/error/weight image, if any

   4. PSF image(s), if any

4. Create ModelObject instance and supply it with data

   1. List of image functions to use

      1. The ModelObject instance will then instantiate corresponding
         FunctionObject instances

   2. PSF image data (if supplied by user)

   3. Image to be fit

   4. Data image characteristics

   5. Oversampled PSF image (if supplied by user)

   6. Mask image data (if supplied by user)

   7. Type of fit statistic to be calculated

   8. Noise/error/weight image data (if supplied by user)

   9. Call FinalSetup() method on the ModelObject instance

5. Do the fit

   1. Set up initial parameter vector and parameter-limits structure
      (mp\_par structure)

   2. Call the user-specified solver (Levenberg-Marquardt is default)

6. Print summary of fit

7. Optionally, do bootstrap resampling to get parameter uncertainty
   estimates

8. Save results

   1. Save best-fitting parameter values

   2. Optionally, save best-fitting model image and/or residual image

General design and operation of makeimage
-----------------------------------------

The operation of makeimage is similar to (but simpler than) imfit.

The key difference in terms of generating the model image is that the
user must specify the *size* of the output image, since there is no data
image to use as a reference. There are three ways to do this:

1. Command-line options (``--ncols``, ``--nrows``)

2. Specification within the configuration file (lines beginning NROWS
   and NCOLS)

3. Use a reference image (``--refimage`` command-line option)

The basic operation of makeimage, as implemented in makeimage\_main.cpp,
is:

1. Process command-line options

2. Read and process configuration file

   1. Specifications of the model: functions and parameter values

   2. Optional image-size specifications

3. Read in PSF image(s), if supplied

4. Create ModelObject instance and supply it with data

   1. Give it list of image functions to use

   2. PSF image data (if supplied by user)

   3. Dimensions of model image

   4. Oversampled PSF data (if supplied by user)

5. Create model image:

   1. Set up parameter vector

   2. Call CreateModelImage() method of ModelObject instance, passing in
      the parameter vector

6. Save the image

   1. Generate string vector of comments for image header

   2. Call SaveVectorAsImage() function (image\_io.h).

The ModelObject Class
---------------------

The heart of Imfit is the ModelObject class. This is instantiated once
in each program, and holds (among other things) the following objects
and data ("**imfit only**\ " denotes data used in imfit or imfit-mcmc,
but not needed when used in makeimage)

-  Model image pixel values

-  Vector of FunctionObject instances which define the model

-  Array of parameter values for the model

-  Image pixel data for PSFs, if any

-  Convolver objects(s) for PSF convolution

-  **imfit only**: Data image pixel values

-  **imfit only**: other characteristics of data image (size, gain, read
   noise, etc.)

-  **imfit only**: Error image (either supplied by user or internally
   generated)

-  **imfit only**: Mask image, if supplied by user

-  **imfit only**: Internal weight image (from combination of error
   image and weight image).

Not all of these data members are initialized or used -- for example,
none of the data-related ("**imfit only**\ ") members are used by
makeimage, and the error image is not generated or used if a fit uses
Poisson-based statistics instead of chi^2.

The main functionality of the class includes:

-  Generating a model image using the vector of FunctionObjects and the
   current array of parameter values

-  Generating individual-function model images (i.e., the
   ``--output-functions`` option of makeimage)

-  Computing individual-function and total fluxes for current model

-  Computing deviances vector between current model image and data image
   (for use by Levenberg-Marquardt solver)

-  Computing the fit statistic (chi^2, etc.) from comparison of the
   current model image and the data image

-  Printing current parameter values

-  Generating a bootstrap resampling pixel-index vector when bootstrap
   resampling is being done

FunctionObject Classes
----------------------

A model image is the sum of individual model images computed using
single image functions, each of which is an instance of a FunctionObject
subclass. For example, a model which is the sum of a central point
source, a Sersic bulge, and an exponential disk would be the sum of
individual images created with the PointSource, Sersic, and Exponential
classes. Multiple instances of each class can be used.

Each image function is a subclass of the abstract base class
FunctionObject. The main methods of this class are:

-  Setup() -- Called by ModelObject to pass in the current parameter
   vector at the beginning of the computation of a model image; this
   allows the image function to store the relevant parameter values and
   do any useful computations that don't depend on pixel position.

-  GetValue() -- Called by ModelObject once for each pixel in the model
   image, to pass in the current pixel values (x,y); the image function
   uses these to compute and return the appropriate intensity value for
   that pixel.

Constructing a model image
--------------------------

The actual generation of pixel values in the model image depends on the
vector of FunctionObjects and the current array of corresponding
parameter values. (And, of course, convolution with a PSF if that is
requested.) The FunctionObjects vector contains instantiations of one or
more classes (e.g., Gaussian, Exponential, Sersic, ExponentialDisk3D)
which are subclasses of the abstract base class FunctionObject (defined
in function\_object.h).

When a model image is constructed, the first step is to call the Setup()
method on each FunctionObject and pass in the corresponding parameter
values. This enables the FunctionObject instances to do any initial
computations which don't depend on actual location within the image.

The value of an individual pixel in the model image is obtained by
iterating over the individual FunctionObjects, calling its GetValue()
method with the current pixel coordinates (*x*,\ *y*), and adding up all
the return values. This all takes place within a loop which iterates
over all the pixels in the model image; this loop is wrapped in OpenMP
directives to allow parallelization across multiple CPU cores.
