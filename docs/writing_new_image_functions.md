# How to Write New Image Functions

## Overview

Imfit comes with a variety of 2D surface-brightness functions ("image functions").
But it is designed to make it relatively simple to add *new* image functions, to 
describe objects or substructures which are not well modeled by the existing functions.
This is done by writing additional C++ code and re-compiling the various Imfit programs
(`imfit`, `imfit-mcmc`, `makeimage`) to include the new function or functions.

This page provides some guidelines on how to write new image
functions (see also the "Rolling Your Own Image Functions" section of
the [Imfit
manual](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/resources/imfit/imfit_howto.pdf),
from which this page is excerpted). Even if you're not very familiar
with C++, it should hopefully not be too difficult to write a new image
function, since it can be done by copying and modifying one of the
existing image functions.

A new image function is written in C++ as a subclass of the
FunctionObject base class, which is declared and defined in the
`function_object.h` and `function_object.cpp` source-code files (in the
`function_objects/` subdirectory of the source-code distribution).

A new image-function class should provide its own implementation of
(i.e., "override") the following public FunctionObject methods, which
are defined as virtual methods in the base class:

- The class constructor -- in most cases, the code for this can be copied from any of the
existing FunctionObject subclasses, unless some special extra initialization is needed.

- `Setup()` -- this is used by the calling program to supply the current
set of function parameters (including the (*x*0,*y*0) pixel values for
the center of the function set) prior to determining intensity values
for individual pixels. The parameter values in the input array should be
assigned to the appropriate data members of the class. This is also a
convenient place to do any general calculations which depend on the
parameter values but don't depend on the exact pixel (*x*,*y*) values.

- `GetValue()` -- this is used by the calling program to obtain the surface
brightness for a given pixel location (*x*,*y*). In existing FunctionObject subclasses,
this method often calls other (private) methods to handle details of the calculation.

- `GetClassShortName()` -- this is a class function which returns
the short version of the class name as a string.


The new class should also redefine the following internal class constants:

-  `N_PARAMS` --- the number of input parameters (*excluding* the
central pixel coordinates);
-  `PARAM_LABELS` --- a vector of string labels for the input parameters;
-  `FUNCTION_NAME` --- a short string describing the function;
-  `className` --- a string (no spaces allowed) giving the official name
of the function.

The ``add_functions.cpp`` file should then be updated by:

- including the header file for the new class;
- adding 2 lines to the `PopulateFactoryMap()` function to add the ability to create an instance of
the new class. (Look for the comment line "// ADD CODE FOR NEW FUNCTIONS HERE" in
the file.)

Finally, the name of the C++ implementation file for the new class should be added
to the `SConstruct` file to ensure it gets included in the compilation; the
easiest thing is to add the file's name (without the `.cpp` suffix) to the
multi-line `functionobject_obj_string` string definition. (Or look for the
comment line "# ADD CODE FOR NEW FUNCTIONS HERE" in the `SConstruct` file.)

Existing examples of FunctionObject subclasses can be found in the `function_objects/`
subdirectory of the source-code distribution, and are the best place to look in order
to get a better sense of how to implement new FunctionObject subclasses.


## A Simple Example

To demonstrate the basics of writing a new image function, we'll modify
the existing Gaussian class to make a class called NewMoffat, which
produces an elliptical structure with a Moffat radial profile. (Such a
function already exists in Imfit under the name Moffat, so this is really a
redundant exercise.)

Three basic changes to the existing `func_gauss.h/cpp` files are needed:

1. Change the class name (in this case, from "Gaussian" to "NewMoffat");

2. Change the code which actually computes the function;

3. Add, rename, and delete class data members to accommodate the new algorithm.


### 1. Create and Edit the Header File

Assuming we're in the Imfit source code directory, `cd` to the `function_objects/`
subdirectory, copy the header file `func_gaussian.h` to `func_new-moffat.h`, and
edit the file to change the following lines:

    #define CLASS_SHORT_NAME "Gaussian"
    
    class Gaussian : public FunctionObject
    
    Gaussian( );

to

    #define CLASS_SHORT_NAME "NewMoffat"
    
    class NewMoffat : public FunctionObject
    
    NewMoffat( );




### 2. Create and Edit the Class File

Copy the file `func_gaussian.cpp` to `func_new-moffat.cpp`.

A. Change the following lines in the beginning of the file:

    #include "func_gaussian.h"
    
    const int N_PARAMS = 4;
    const char PARAM_LABELS[][20] = {"PA", "ell", "I_0", "sigma"};
    const char FUNCTION_NAME[] = "Gaussian function";
    
    
to

    #include "func_new-moffat.h"
    
    const int N_PARAMS = 5;
    const char PARAM_LABELS[][20] = {"PA", "ell", "I_0", "fwhm", "beta"};
    const char FUNCTION_NAME[] = "Moffat function";

B. In the remainder of the file, change all references to the class name from
`Gaussian` to `NewMoffat` (e.g., `Gaussian::Setup` becomes `NewMoffat::Setup`).

C. Change the `Setup` method. Here, you'll need to change how the input parameter
array is converted into individual parameters, and do any useful pre-computations 
(i.e., computations that depend on the parameter values, but not on individual pixel
values or values derived from the latter, like radius).

Change

    PA = params[0 + offsetIndex];
    ell = params[1 + offsetIndex];
    I_0 = params[2 + offsetIndex];
    sigma = params[3 + offsetIndex];

to

    PA = params[0 + offsetIndex];
    ell = params[1 + offsetIndex];
    I_0 = params[2 + offsetIndex];
    fwhm = params[3 + offsetIndex];
    beta = params[4 + offsetIndex];

Then, at the end of the method, replaced this line

    twosigma_squared = 2.0 * sigma*sigma;

with this (which computes the "alpha" parameter of the Moffat function)

    double exponent = pow(2.0, 1.0/beta);
    alpha = 0.5*fwhm/sqrt(exponent = 1.0);


D. Changes to the `CalculateIntensity` method:

Although it is the public method GetValue which is called by other parts of
the program, we don't actually need to change the current version of that method
in this example. The code in the original Gaussian version of GetValue
converts pixel positions to a scaled radius value, given input values for
the center, ellipticity, and position angle, and then calls the private method
CalculateIntensity to determine the intensity as a function of the radius.
Since we're still assuming a perfectly elliptical shape, we can keep the
existing code. (GetValue also includes possible pixel subsampling, which
is useful for cases where intensity changes rapidly one scales of a single pixel;
we'll apply a simple modification for the Moffat function later on.)

So in this case we actually implement the details of the new function's algorithm in
CalculateIntensity. Replace the original version of that method with the
following:


    double NewMoffat::CalculateIntensity( double r )
    {
      double  scaledR, denominator;
  
      scaledR = r / alpha;
      denominator = pow((1.0 + scaledR*scaledR), beta);
      return (I_0 / denominator);
    }


E. Changes to the `CalculateSubsamples` method:

Although pixel subsampling is performed in the GetValues method, the
determination of whether or not to actually *do** the subsampling
-- and how much of it to do -- is determined in CalcualteSubsamples.

For the Gaussian function, subsampling can be useful
happen when *r* < 1 *and* sigma < 1. The equivalent
for the Moffat function would be *r* < 1 and alpha < 1, so
change the line in CalculateSubsamples that says

    if ((sigma <= 1.0) && (r <= 1.0))

to say

    if ((alpha <= 1.0) && (r <= 1.0))



At this point, most of the work is done.  We only need to update the code
in ``add_functions.cpp`` so it knows about the new function and
update the ``SConstruct`` file so that the new function is included in the
compilation.


## Other Potential Issues

If your new image function has an analytic expression for the total flux, then
you might consider overriding the CanCalculateTotalFlux method to return `true`
and then override the `TotalFlux` method so that it calculates and returns the
total flux. (The default is to let `makeimage` estimate the total flux numerically,
by generating a large image using the image function and summing all the pixel
values.)

If your new image function is meant to represent the image *background* (as in the
case of the built-in function FlatSky), then you may not want `makeimage` trying
to calculate the "total flux" for the component. In this case, you can override
the `IsBackground` method so that it returns `true` (as in `func_flatsky.h`
and `func_flatsky.cpp`).
