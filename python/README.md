## Python Directory

This directory contains ancillary Python code for Imfit -- mainly code to assist in running
some of the regression tests.

To make full use of the test-related code, you will need numpy, mpmath, and either astropy or
pyfits installed.

There are also some preliminary examples of code to help in analyzing Imfit output -- e.g.,
imfit.py, which can read and parse imfit output best-fit parameter files. (May be out of date.)
